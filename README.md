An [Agricultural Research Federation] (AgReFed) project, the `eeharvest` package
simplifies access to Google Earth Engine and its data catalog with a trio of
convenient methods to collect, process and download data:

- `preprocess()`: server-side processing, cloud and shadow masking, image
  reduction and calculation of spectral indices
- `aggregate()`: **ðŸš§(work-in-progress)ðŸš§** perform additional temporal aggregaton
  on data
- `download()`: download data collection(s) to disk without limits on size or
  number of files

### Why `eeharvest`?

This package is part of the AgReFed [Geodata-Harvester] project which extends
the vision of providing Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
agricultural data (and beyond) to Australian researchers and stakeholders. 

The Geodata-Harvester project enables researchers with convenient and reusable
workflows and provides open-source software for automatic data extraction from a
wide range of data sources including spatial-temporal processing. The
`eeharvest` package provides access to data beyond the shores of Australia,
therefore it has been designed to work as a standalone product for anyone to
use.

## Features

- [x] **Download** from any dataset available on the [Google Earth Engine Data Catalog]
- [x] Perform automatic cloud and shadow **masking** (credit: `eemont`)
- [x] **Scale** and **offset** image bands instantly (credit: `eemont`)
- [x] **Spatial** aggregation/reduction (e.g. median)
- [ ] **Temporal** aggregation/reduction (ðŸš§ _in progress_ ðŸš§)
- [x] Quickly calculate from a vast library of **spectral indices**, e.g. NDVI, BAI (credit: [Awesome Spectral Indices])
- [x] **Preview** assets instantly using interactive **maps**, including calculated spectral
  indices (credit: `geemap`)
- [x] **Downlod** any number of image assets with (almost) no size limits - _please
  be sensible with this feature_ (credit:
  `geedim`)
- [x] **Automate** _all_ of the above with the use of **YAML** config files

## Examples

```python
from eeharvest import harvester

harvester.initialise()

# specify collection, coordinates and date range
img = harvester.collect(
        collection="LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2",
        coords=[149.799, -30.31, 149.80, -30.309],
        date_min="2019-01-01",
        date_max="2019-02-01",
    )

# cloud and shadow masking, spatial aggregation, NDVI calculation
img.preprocess(mask_clouds=True, reduce="median", spectral="NDVI")

# download to disk (defaults to a "downloads" folder in working directory)
img.download(bands="NDVI")
```

## Installation

### Installing dependencies from conda

Before installing the package you may need to install the following packages
manually:

- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html): to manipulate raster and vector
  geospatial data
- [gcloud
  CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install): needed to authenticate
  to Google servers

In most cases, these can be installed through conda-forge (but see alternatives
below if not):

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge gdal google-cloud-sdk
```

### Installing dependencies from binaries

If conda is somehow not an option, you can install the two dependencies from
binaries. For GDAL, use `apt-get` or `brew` (macOS). Clear instructions have
been written on the
[rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) website.
For the Google Cloud SDK, follow the instructions on the [gcloud
CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) website.

### Conda - *recommended*

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge eeharvest 
```

### Pip

```sh
pip install eeharvest
```
